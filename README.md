# Laseredstone
### Laser redstone? Lasered stone? Lazy redstone? I have no idea.

Laseredstone adds lasers and mirrors to Minecraft.

Blocks:
1. The core of the mod is the Laser. The Laser can be powered with redstone to shoot a laser beam. If a laser beam hits a laser, it explodes. The laser can be dyed with any assortment of dyes in the crafting table.
2. The Receiver is a block that receives the laser. Upon activation with a laser, it emits a redstone signal.
3. The Vertical-Horizontal Mirror changes the direction of the incoming laser. Depending on the direction, it can turn a vertical laser into a horizontal laser and vice versa. If two lasers hit the mirror simultaneously, it explodes. (Rotates the laser 90 degrees around the x or z axis.)
4. The Horizontal-Horizontal Mirror works similarly to a Vertical-Horizontal Mirror, but only changes between horizontal directions. (Rotates the laser 90 degrees around the y axis.)
5. The Lens is a special type of mirror that extends a signal in a certain direction. (If placed the wrong way, it will redirect the laser the way it came, almost certainly causing an explosion.) Lasers that pass through the Lens will become _overcharged_, dealing high damage to entities that they touch.
